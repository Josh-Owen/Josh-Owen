### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Josh, an Android developer currently residing in Nottingham in the UK. I have had a keen interest in programming from a young age where I was inspired by games such a Zelda and Runescape the mystery in how these games were developed armed me with the curiousity and drive to figure out how they were made which is where my coding adventure began. I have a keen interest in programming ranging from mobile applications, gaming, cloud, automation or just solving general computer science problems. Outside of programming you can often find me playing MMORPGâ€™s, trading stocks on the financial markets or working out.
